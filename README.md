# DHHB-COURSE-PROJECT
Course project for Digital Health and Human Behavior -course at Aalto University.

In this report I will introduce a project where I explore data collected by FitBit activitytracking wristwatches to find some interesting correlations for example between sleep, and activity level, and also to identify different patterns in the participantsâ€™ lifestyles. I also want to explore, how background information of the participants, such as body mass and body mass index, affect their health behavior. Moreover, the aim of this project is to make conclusions both on individual and community level lifestyles and habits and compare the results to the recommended values estimated by scientific papers.

The data analysis indicates that on average, the participants are generally active, but too many of them are severely inactive, which might contribute to the fact that a lot of the participants are not getting sufficient amount of sleep and many of them are overweight. Moreover, it seems that physical inactivity negatively affects sleep duration. However, too high intensity exercise might also negatively affect sleep. As there was very little data on the background information of the participants, such as BMI, it is hard to draw any conclusions based on the participants lifestyles, but overall, it seems that many of them would benefit from more physical activity

This Jupyter Notebook contains all data handling and analysis methods I used during the project.
